We are also required to measure our progress toward having at least 7% of our workforce be individuals with disabilities. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had a disability. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we ask all of our employees to update their information at least every five years. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identifying yourself as an individual with a disability is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so.
